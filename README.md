# Feature Flag API Test

This repo contains the files required to run a simple feature flag API.

Using a feature flag allows for features to be enabled for certain users if they fufill the criteria - in this case, their email address and location.

# Plan

In order to develop this API i aim to split up the development within 5 steps in order to complete it within 3 hours.
